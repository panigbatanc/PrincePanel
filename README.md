  <p>For those servers who are auto-shutdown after few minutes, or hours. Please reinstall your servers if you have time</p>
  <br>
  <p>I have disabled AUTO-WS fixer now, looks like this thing is not meant to be, its hogging server resources that's why auto-shutdown happen</p>
  <br>
  <p>I am sorry for this happening, rest assured it will not happen again, I just want to give a good service to all my panel customers and this thing normally happen anyways</p>
  <br>

  <p>This announcement will be removed automatically later, please do not message me about this. Thank you! - Prince</p>
