<h2>Prince Announcement</h2>
<br>
<p>For Hetzner users, I received a report that Debian 10 is working well ðŸ¥°. I have made changes for script to support Debian 10. If you have time please re-install your Hetzner server to Debian 10 64bit and install again on Panel for stable and long service. Thank you!<p>
