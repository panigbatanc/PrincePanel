<p>Hello my dear brothers, if some of you experience Hetzners problem auto-shutdown this is not a panel problem but Hetzner problems, all type of panels/panel developers experience this problem.</p>
<br>
<p>As a brother what I suggest is for the meantime move to other providers like OVH or Contabo, but choose Germany only, because other countries are not good speed for Arab/Middle East countries.</p>
<br>
<p>I hope everything will get fixed on Hetzner servers soon, Alhamdullilah üôè</p>
